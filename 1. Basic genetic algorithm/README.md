# Homework 1. Basic optimization of a genetic algorithm

This exercise requires:

1) Understand the attached optimization algorithm.

2) Detect what makes the algorithm perform not steadily better along generations (i.e. the best solution of the population does not necessarily improve over successive generations).

3) Modify the different evolutionary operators (selection, crossover, mutation, replacement) for the algorithm to perform better.

4) Deliver a written report describing the included modifications, together with the modified script.
